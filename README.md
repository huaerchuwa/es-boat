# es-boat

A prototype of an expert system for coastal navigation - the test example for the [rete4frames] (http://github.com/rururu/rete4frames) expert system shell.

It uses [Protege-3.5 ontology editor] (http://protege.stanford.edu/) as a knowledge representation system and GUI, [OpenStreetMap] (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API) API, [Leaflet] (http://leafletjs.com) JavaScript library and [Cesium] (https://cesiumjs.org/) WebGL virtual globe and map engine.

## Start

```
$ cd <..>/es-boat/pro-server
$ lein run
```
## Usage

In the Protege window, run the menu item: Edit -> ClojureWork.

This starts a script that loads needed programs, starts expert system and opens browser window with a HUD and the controls of a boat. Set a throttle to some reasonable boat speed value in nautical miles. Contol course of the boat with a helm. The helm has 5 positions, from left to right: "hard a port", "port", "midship", "starboard", "hard a starboard". Preferred browser is Google Chrome.

You can open a nautical chart in another browser window on the address http://localhost:4444/chart.html.

For now expert system answer questions only about nearby islands and shows them on the HUD. Stay tuned.
